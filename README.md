# DocBook XSLT 2.0 Stylesheets

These are the XSLT 2.0 stylesheets for DocBook. These stylesheets
represent a different line of development from the
[XSLT 1.0](https://github.com/docbook/xslt10-stylesheets).

That said, they are clearly derived from that work, so tip o' the hat
to everyone who's helped over there. And a special nod to Jirka Kosek
who did a lot of work on the XSLT 2.0 FO stylesheets.

Although I've been using the 2.0 stylesheets almost exclusively for a
number of years, there may still be bugs. The test suite is running
again now, though, so that should be less and less the case.

Releases are published
[on GitHub](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-stylesheets/releases)
and
[Maven](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22docbook-xslt2%22).

Resources (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are maintained in
[a separate repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-resources).
They are also available from [the DocBook CDN](https://cdn.docbook.org/).

Some image options, such as scaling, require information about the intrinsic
size of the image. There are Java extension functions for this purpose.
They are maintained in
[another repository](https://github.com/docbook/xslt20-java). Put them
on your class path. They are also
[in Maven](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22docbook-xsl-java-saxon%22), if you prefer.
