               <div class="line">And the great care of goods at random left</div>
               <div class="line">Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</div>
               <div class="line">From whom my absence was not six months old</div>
               <div class="line">Before herself, almost at fainting under</div>
               <div class="line">The pleasing punishment that women bear,</div>
               <div class="line">Had made provision for her following me</div>
               <div class="line">And soon and safe arrived where I was.</div>
               <div class="line">There had she not been long, but she became</div>
               <div class="line">A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</div>
               <div class="line">And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</div>
               <div class="line">As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</div>
               <div class="line">That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</div>
               <div class="line">A meaner woman was delivered</div>
               <div class="line">Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</div>
               <div class="line">Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</div>
               <div class="line">I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</div>
               <div class="line">My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</div>
               <div class="line">Made daily motions for our home return:</div>
               <div class="line">Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</div>
               <div class="line">We came aboard.</div>
               <div class="line">A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</div>
               <div class="line">Before the always wind-obeying deep</div>
               <div class="line">Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</div>
               <div class="line">But longer did we not retain much hope;</div>
               <div class="line">For what obscured light the heavens did grant</div>
               <div class="line">Did but convey unto our fearful minds</div>
               <div class="line">A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</div>
               <div class="line">Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</div>
               <div class="line">Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</div>
               <div class="line">Weeping before for what she saw must come,</div>
               <div class="line">And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</div>
               <div class="line">That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</div>
               <div class="line">Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</div>
               <div class="line">And this it was, for other means was none:</div>
               <div class="line">The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</div>
               <div class="line">And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</div>
               <div class="line">My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</div>
               <div class="line">Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</div>
               <div class="line">Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</div>
               <div class="line">To him one of the other twins was bound,</div>
               <div class="line">Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</div>
               <div class="line">The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</div>
               <div class="line">Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</div>
               <div class="line">Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</div>
               <div class="line">And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</div>
               <div class="line">Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</div>
               <div class="line">At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</div>
               <div class="line">Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</div>
               <div class="line">And by the benefit of his wished light,</div>
               <div class="line">The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</div>
               <div class="line">Two ships from far making amain to us,</div>
